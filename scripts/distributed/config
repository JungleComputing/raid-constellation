# Add all SSH addresses on which constellation will run.
# To  avoid being asked for a password each time, setup SSH keys.

# Example:
# computeAddresses=(\

# "odroid@10.72.21.38" \
#)

# Add all the compute nodes and their context separated with a space
# Nodes will ONLY process Activities with a label matching one or more
# indicated contexts
